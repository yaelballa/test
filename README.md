## Exercise Info

I used react-create-app to save time on env setup for react
Since you said I can have a different design I used material UI for the design since it is nice (and also saved me time)
I used thunk middleware for async actions but usually it is better to define a specific middleware for the flow, in this project there is no need for that
I didn't handle any errors that might arrive from server
I didn't add tests other then the basic one for rendering, which in real project of course is not enough
